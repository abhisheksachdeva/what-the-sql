A simple online SQL querying test based on [jitbit's SQL
interview](http://www.jitbit.com/news/181-jitbits-sql-interview-questions/).  If you think
you might need a refresher in basic SQL querying, focusing on the types of
queries you might have to write for an application, [give it a try!](http://wts.jmoiron.net).

This test covers the basics that all developers dealing with sql *should* know.
You might not be able to rattle off each query without looking at any SQL documentation,
but you should more or less know the way to get to the answer.  Important concepts
that are tested include basic `GROUP BY ... HAVING` queries, `INNER` and `OUTER` joins
(SQLite lacks `OUTER JOIN` (RIGHT), but has `LEFT OUTER JOIN`, be careful!),
basic aggregation functions like COUNT, MAX, and SUM, and basic data functions
like COALESCE.
